{% load i18n %}{% blocktrans %}Hello {{ username }}!

The image for your wireless router ({{ hostname }}/{{ ip }}) has been
generated! You can flash it directly to your router using the instructions
which can be found on the following page:
  
  http://wlan-lj.net/wiki/Navodila/Flashing

The generated files for your node are available here:{% endblocktrans %}
{% for file in files %}
  http://nodes.wlan-lj.net/results/{{ file }}
{% endfor %}
{% blocktrans %}Note that these files will only remain available for 5 days.
After that time, they will be removed from the server and you will have to
regenerate the image. You may also wish to place a sticker describing the
wireless node on the node container - the sticker can be generated by
visiting:

  http://nodes.wlan-lj.net/nodes/sticker

Thank you for your participation in the project!

Best regards,
wlan ljubljana network <open@wlan-lj.net>
