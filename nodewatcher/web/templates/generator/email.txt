Hello {{ username }}!

The image for your wireless router ({{ hostname }}/{{ ip }}) has been
generated! You can flash it directly to your router using the instructions
which can be found on the following page:
  
  http://wlan-lj.net/wiki/HowToFlash

The generated files for your node are available here:{% endblocktrans %}
  {% for file in files %}
  http://nodes.wlan-lj.net/results/{{ file }}
  {% endfor %}
{% blocktrans %}Note that these files will only remain available for 5 days.
After that time, they will be removed from the server and you will have to
regenerate the image.

Thank you for your participation in the project!

Best regards,
wlan ljubljana network <open@wlan-lj.net>
