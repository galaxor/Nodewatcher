{% load i18n %}{% blocktrans %}Hello {{ username }}!

The image for your wireless router ({{ hostname }}/{{ ip }}) has been
generated! You can flash it directly to your router using the instructions
which can be found on the following page:
  
  http://wlan-lj.net/wiki/Navodila/Flashing

The generated files for your node are available here:{% endblocktrans %}
{% for file in files %}
  http://bindist.wlan-lj.net/images/{{ file.name }}
  MD5: {{ file.checksum }}
{% endfor %}
{% blocktrans %}Note that these files will only remain available for 5 days. After that
time, they will be removed from the server and you will have to regenerate
the image.

You may also wish to place a sticker describing the wireless node on the
node container. More about that can be found here:

  http://wlan-lj.net/wiki/Navodila/Nalepka

Thank you for your participation in the project!

Best regards,
