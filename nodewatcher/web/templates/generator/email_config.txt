Router configuration for ({{ hostname }}/{{ ip }}) has been generated!
You can use it as a starting point for your custom router configuration so
that its settings are compatible with the network.

Configuration archive listed below contains files suitable for use with the
{{ network.name }} firmware. Because of this, some settings may require patches
and/or are version related. For further information consult:

  http://wlan-lj.net/wiki/Podrobnosti/PoMeri

The generated configuration archive is available here:{% endblocktrans %}

  http://bindist.wlan-lj.net/images/{{ config }}
  MD5: {{ checksum }}

{% blocktrans %}Note that these files will only remain available for 5 days. After that
time, they will be removed from the server and you will have to request them
again.

Thank you for your participation in the project!

Best regards,
{{ network.name }} network <{{ network.contact }}>
